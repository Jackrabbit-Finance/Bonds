# Bonds

Jackrabbit Bonds are based on the EIP 3475 standard created by the D/Bond Protocol. D/Bond acts as a "third party" to manage the bond exchange. The D/Bond Protocol also has KYC.

Jackrabbit adds more liquidity to D/Bond's bond exchange while also allowing users to add liquidity, stake, and buy bonds with funds from other chains.
